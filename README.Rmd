The goal of hubExamples is to provide example data for forecasting and scenario modeling hubs in the hubverse format.

This package is part of the [hubverse](https://hubverse.io/en/latest/) ecosystem, which aims to provide a set of tools for infectious disease modeling hubs to share and collaborate on their work.

## Installation

### Latest

You can install the [latest version of hubExamples from the R-universe](https://hubverse-org.r-universe.dev/hubExamples):

```r
install.packages("hubExamples", repos = c("https://hubverse-org.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

### Development

If you want to test out new features that have not yet been released, you can install the development version of hubExamples from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("hubverse-org/hubExamples")
```

## Example forecast hub data

The package provides three data sets that contain example model output and
target data for an example forecast hub: `forecast_outputs`, `forecast_target_ts`, and
`forecast_oracle_output`.  Please see the package documentation for further information about these data objects.

```{r forecast_example}
library(hubExamples)
head(forecast_outputs)
head(forecast_target_ts)
head(forecast_oracle_output)
```

## Example scenario hub data

The package provides two data sets that contain example model output and
target data for an example scenario hub: `scenario_outputs` and `scenario_target_ts`.  Please see the package documentation for further information about these data objects.

```{r scenario_example}
head(scenario_outputs)
head(scenario_target_ts)
```
